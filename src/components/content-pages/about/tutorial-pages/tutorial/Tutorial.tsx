            <h3>What are Remittances?</h3>
            <p>
              A remittance is a sum of money transferred from one party to
              another - typically abroad. They are often used by migrants
              sending home part of their earnings in the form of either cash or
              goods to support their families back home.
            </p>

            <p>
              We recognize that remittance rates in Africa are too high, which
              is why we offer an affordable alternative solution to sending
              money overseas to Africa.
